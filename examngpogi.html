      <p>#StayHumble #MoveInSilence #Unbothered"</p><br>    
      <p>Happy soul, humble heart, and a quiet mind—just the way I like it. I don’t speak much about my problems because I believe in handling them in silence. Life has taught me that not everything needs to be said, and not everyone needs to know your next move. I stay lowkey, focused, and unbothered. Peace is my priority, and negativity has no space in my world. I smile often, not because life is perfect, but because I choose happiness over stress. My energy speaks louder than words, and my actions prove more than promises. I don’t chase attention; I attract it effortlessly. Confidence is quiet, insecurities are loud—I choose the quiet side. Being humble doesn’t mean being weak; it means knowing my worth without needing to prove it. I move smart, stay sharp, and let success make the noise. Handsome, humble, and at peace—that’s just the way I am</p><br>

      <p>#I can't study anymore.</p><br>    
      <p>As this chapter of our lives comes to an end, I find myself reflecting on the moments we’ve shared throughout our time together. It’s not easy to say goodbye, especially to people who have become such a big part of my everyday life.    
We’ve laughed together during stressful nights, pushed through deadlines, supported each other through exams, and celebrated each other’s wins—both big and small. College wouldn’t have been the same without the friendships, the random conversations, the group projects, and even the late-night cramming sessions.To be honest, this goodbye is even harder for me because I won’t be able to continue my studies next year. I'm short of money, and unfortunately, I have to take a break from school. It hurts to step away from something I care about so much, and from people who have become like family.</p>
